They are intimately associated with DNA replication, recombination, cell cycle, and apoptosis DNA damage bypass Does not remove damage, but allows trans-lesion DNA synthesis (TLS) using a damaged template strand. TLS allows cells to complete DNA replication postponing repair until cell division finishes. DNA polymerases utilized are error-prone, frequently introducing base substitutions and/or small insertions and deletions DNA damage reversal Acts on a very narrow spectrum of damaging base modifications to remove modifying groups and restore bases to original state Base excision repair (BER) Involves several DNA glycosylases that cleave a vast array of damaged bases from the DNA sugar-phosphate backbone Glycosylases create an abasic site that is then processed by endonuclease, polymerases, and ligases. Choice of processing depends on cell cycle stage, glycosylase identity, and presence of additional damage Yields error free DNA molecules Nucleotide excision repair (NER) Removes bulky lesions that cause distortion of the DNA double helix Excise oligonucleotide that contains the lesion from affected DNA strand Followed by gap filling DNA synthesis and ligation of repaired molecule Mismatch repair (MMR) MMR proteins recognize mismatched BPs or small indel loops during DNA replication and correct erroneous pairing by excising mismatched nucleotides exclusively from nascent DNA strand leaving template in tact Repair of double strand breaks (DSBs) Can be repaired very accurately with homologous recombination repair (HRR) Other error prone pathways to repair include: non homologous end joining (NHEJ) Single Strand annealing (SSA) Microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) DSBs generated through DNA damaging agents like X-rays or Reactive oxygen species (ROS) Are also intermediates of the Fanconi Anemia pathway Repair of interstrand crosslinks (Fanconi anemia pathway) Inter-stand cross-linking (ICL) agents damage DNA by introducing covalent bonds between two DNA strands, this prevents progression of a DNA replication fork Fanconi anemia proteins repair ICLs by unhooking them from on DNA strand. TLS enables replication fork to bypass unhooked ICL resulting in two replicated DNA molecules One contains a DSB and triggers double strand break repair One contains bulky unhooked ICL that is removed using NER Suggested review: Lindahl and Wood 1999 and Curtin 2012 Fanconi Anemia (FA) Pathway: R-HSA-6783310.2 FA is a genetic disease of genome instability characterized by congenital skeletal defects, aplastic anemia, leukemia susceptibility, cellular sensitivity to DNA damaging events 15 complementation groups (FA-A, -B, -C, -D1, -D2, -E, -F, -G, -I, -J, -L, -M, -N, -O and -P) Groups correspond to the genes: FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCD1/BRCA2, FANCD2, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCJ/BRIP1, FANCL, FANCM, FANCN/PALB2, FANCO/RAD51C and FANCP/SLX4 Eight of these proteins, FANCA, FANCB, FANCC, FANCE, FANCF, FANCG, FANCL, and FANCM, together with FAAP24, FAAP100, FAAP20, APITD1 and STRA13 Create nuclear complex termed FA Core Complex E3 ubiquitin ligase that recognizes and is activated by ICLs Triggers mono-ubiquitination of FANCD2 and FANCI which initiates repair of ICL-DNA FANCD2 and FANCI form a complex and are mutually dependent on one another for their respective monoubiquitination After DNA damage and during S phase, FANCD2 localizes to discrete nuclear foci that colocalize with proteins involved in homologous recombination repair like BRCA1 and RAD51 FA Regulated by ubiquitination/phosphorilation of FANCD2 and FANCI ATR-dependent phosphorylation of FANCI and FANCD2 promotes monoubiquitination of FANCD2 stimulating FA pathway Monoubiquitinated FANCD2 recruits DNA nucleases including SLX4(FANCP) and FAN1 which unhook the ICL from one of the covalently linked DNA strands DNA polymerase nu (POLN) performs translation DNA synthesis using the DNA strand with the unhooked ICL as a template to bypass the unhooked ICL NER then removes the unhooked ICL Incision of stalled replication fork during the unhooking step generates a DSB repaired via HRR involving BRCA2 (FANCD1), PALB2 (FANCN), and BRIP1(FANCJ) Homozygous mutations in BRCA2, PALB2, or BRIP1 result in FA Heterozygous mutations predispose carriers to breast and ovarian cancer These proteins role in DNA repair is BRCA1 dependent Heterozygous BRCA1 mutations predispose to breast and ovarian cancer with high penetance Loss of BRCA1 is embryonic lethal Partial gremlin loss of BRCA1 function results in FA-like syndrome \u2014 BRCA1 designated FANCS gene monoubiquitination: addition of a single ubiquitin peptide to the lysine of a protein Mismatch Repair (MMR): R-HSA-5358508.1 Corrects single base mismatches and small insertion and deletion loops (IDLs) of unpaired bases. Highly conserved across prokaryotes and eukaryotes Primarily associated with DNA replication Basic Steps: A sensor (MutS homologue) detects mismatch or IDL Activates a set of proteins (MutL homologue and an exonuclease) to select, nick, and exonucleolytically remove region of nucleotides from the nascent strand DNA polymerase resynthesizes the strand Ligase seals the remaining nick Humans have two MutS complexes MSH2:MSH6 heterodimer (MutSalpha) : Recognizes single base mismatches and loops of one or two unpaired bases MSH2:MSH3 heterodimer (MutSbeta) : Recognizes loops of two or more unpaired bases Upon binding mismatch, MutS complex activates in an ATP-dependent manner allowing for interactions and movement on DNA substrate Interacts with MLH1:PMS2 and Exonuclease 1 (EXO1) to initiate excision of the recently replicated strand and direct DNA polymerase delta to initiate replacement of bases. MLH1:PMS2 makes an incision in the strand to be repaired EXO1 extends the incision to make a single stranded gap of up to 1kb that removes the mismatched bases In some assays it has been found the EXO1 is not necessary, not sure why. Most of the time it is necessary Replication Protein A (RPA) binds the single stranded region to prevent rewinding of DNA and allows DNA polymerase delta to synthesize new strand Nick sealed by DNA Ligase I (LIG1) Order of steps and structural details not fully known Concentrations of MMR proteins MSH2:MSH6 and MLH1:PMS2 increase in human cells during the S phase where they are at highest level and activity I.E. MutSalpha has highest activity or potential for activity during DNA replication (between G1 and G2) Defects in MSH2, MSH6, MLH1, and PMS2 cause hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC, also known as Lynch syndrome) Mismatch repair (MMR) directed by MSH2:MSH6 (MutSalpha): R-HSA-5358565.1 Single base mismatches and unpaired loops of 1-2 nucleotides Is about 6-fold more abundant than MSH2:MSH3 (MutSbeta) in humans Imbalance of this ratio can cause mutator phenotype MSH6 subunit binds the mismatch which triggers the MSH2:MSH6 complex to exchange ADP to ATP Conformation changes to allow movement on DNA and interact with downstream effectors PCNA: Initiates excision of the recently replicated strand MLH1:PMS2: endonucleolytic activity to make nick EXO1: enlarges gap to hundreds of nucleotides DNA polymerase delta polymerizes across gap, and remaining nick is sealed by DNA ligase I LIG1 Mismatch repair (MMR) directed by MSH2:MSH3 (MutSbeta): R-HSA-5358606.1 Binds unpaired loops of 2 or more nucleotides 6x lower in concentration than alpha Similar information as for MutSalpha Key differences: MSH3 NOT specified to be the subunit that binds Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER): R-HSA-5696398.2 Tree: Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) Global Genome Nucleotide Excision Repair (GG-NER) DNA Damage Recognition in GG-NER Dual incision in GG-NER Formation of Incision Complex in GG-NER Gap-filling DNA repair synthesis and ligation in GG-NER Transcription-Coupled Nucleotide Excision Repair (TC-NER) Dual incision in TC-NER Formation of TC-NER Pre-Incision Complex Gap-filling DNA repair synthesis and ligation in TC-NER NER Overview First described in E.coli ~1960 as the process whereby bulky base damage is enzymatically removed from DNA facilitating the recovery of DNA synthesis and cell survival Deficient NER processes linked to increased mutation rate and cancer Unique in prokaryotes but highly conserved in yeast and higher eukaryotes NER involved in repair of bulky adducts in DNA UV-induced photo lesions 6-4 photoproducts (6-4 PDDS) Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) Chemical adducts formed from exposure to aflatoxin, benzopyrene and other genotoxic agents Two primary pathways: differ in method that DNA damage is initially recognized. Mostly same downstream Global Genome Nucleotide Excision Repair (GG-NER): transcription-independent and removes lesions from coding and non-coding DNA strands that are not being actively transcribed Transcription-coupled nucleotide excision repair (TC-NER): repairs damage in transcribed strands of active genes Several proteins involved in NER are key to basal transcription complex TFIIH. An ubiquitin ligase complex composed of DDB1, CUL4A or CUL4B and RBX1 participates in both GG and TC NER Suggests important role of ubiquitination in NER regulation Mouse models used to establish relation of NER defects and cancer Suggested review: Lindahl and Wood 1998, Friedberg et al. 2002, Christmann et al. 2003, Hanawalt and Spivak 2008, Marteijn et al. 2014 Global Genome Nucleotide Excision Repair (GG-NER): R-HSA-5696399.1 Steps: DNA recognition seen as joint action of two protein complexes First complex (XPC Complex): XPC, RAD23A or RAD23B, CETN2 UV-DDB complex: ubiquitin ligase composed of DDB1, CUL4A or CUL4B, RBX1, and GG-NER specific protein DDB2 In-vitro only necessary for GG-NER mediated repair of UV-induced pyrimidine dimers In vivo, where DNA repair occurs in chromatin context, likely facilitates GG-NER mediated repair irrespective of DNA damage type After damage recognition, TFIIH complex with XPA verifies damage, unwinds helix around damage thereby creating an open bubble Two endonuclease ERCC5 (XPG) and comely of ERCC1 and ERCC4 (XPF) excise oligonucleotide that contains damaged base(s) DNA poly delta, epsilon, and/or kappa perform DNA repair synthesis DNA ligated DNA Damage Recognition in GG-NER: R-HSA-5696394.1 First complex of XPC, RAD23A/RAD23B and CETN2: Probes DNA helix and recognizes disruption in normal Watson-Crick base pairing Results in binding of the XPC:RAD23:CETN2 complex to undamaged DNA strand Second Complex UV-DDB is necessary for recognition of UV-induced DNA damage and may contribute to retention of first complex Binds the damaged DNA strand Dual Incision in GG-NER: R-HSA-5696400.1 Dual incision at the damaged DNA strand excises the oligonucleotide that contains the lesion from the open bible. Excised region is ~27-30 bases long 5\u2019 incision by ERCC1:ERCC4 endonuclease 3\u2019 incision by ERCC5 endonuclease Formation of Incision Complex in GG-NER: R-HSA-5696395.1 After XPC complex and UV-DDB complex bind damaged DNA, a basal transcription factor TFIIH is recruited to the NER site DNA helicases ERCC2 (XPD) and ERCC3 (XPB) are subunits of TFIIH complex ERCC2 unwinds the DNA around the damage in concert with ATPase activity of ERCC3 Creates open bubble Simultaneously presence of the damage is verified by XPA Recruitment of XPA is partially regulated by PARP1 and PARP2 During excision by ERCC1:ERCC4 and ERCC5, RPA heterotrimer coats the undamaged na strand to protect it from endonucleolytic attack Gap-filling DNA repair synthesis and ligation in GG-NER: R-HSA-5696397.1 GG-NER completed by DNA repair synthesis that fills the single stranded gap created after excision Performed by DNA polymerase epsilon or delta or the \u201cY family DNA polymerase kappa\u201d (POLK) LIG1 or LIg3 (as part of LIG3:XRCC1 complex) ligate newly synthesized stretch of oligonucleotides Transcription-Coupled Nucleotide Excision Repair (TC-NER): R-HSA-6781827.1 Damage in transcribed strands of active genes repaired through Transcription-coupled NER Impairment in TC-NER is underlying cause of severe hereditary disorder Cockayne syndrome and an autosomal recessive disease characterized by hypersensitivity to UV light Triggered by helix distorting lesions that block the progression of elongating RNA polymerase II (RNA Pol II) Stalled RNA Pol II complex triggers recruitment of ERCC6 (or CSB Cockayne Syndrome Protein B) which recruits ERCC8 (Cockayne syndrome protein A or CSA) ERC88 has 7 WD repeat motifs (forms a ring of triangles) and is part of ubiquitin ligase complex that includes DDB1 CUL4A or CUL4B and RBX1 SIMILAR in structure to UVDDB from GG-NER but lacks DDB2 Key regulator of TC-NER that may exert role by ubiquitinating one or more factors involved in repair like RNA pol II and ERCC6 TFIIH (transcription elongation factor) recruited to TC-NER site Pre-incision complex includes XPA, XAB2 complex, TCEA1 (TFIIS), HMGN1, UVSSA in complex with USP7, and EP300(p300).
